# Intro

a header-only library, first version.
I thought I got a bug, but it wasn't. The image data is up side down by right. And usually a stixel's axis has the positive direction pointing from bottom to top of the image. Perhaps that's the reason why the image data is up side down.

# TODO

# How to use
